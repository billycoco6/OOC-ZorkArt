‘.idea’ is auto-generated from intelliJ, which includes .xml files such as compiler, workspace and modules. They are not required to run in other computers.
‘.DS-Store’ is auto-generated from Mac, so we do not need to include this file in project.
‘.iml’ is a base file same as '.idea' it is auto-generated from intelliJ.
‘target/‘ is required for maven to test, so in other computers we can build the new maven package and get 'target' folder.
